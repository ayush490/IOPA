# IOPA

Made a CNN based model which can identify and classify X-Ray Types of dental radiograph.

It eventually trains the model from the test images and finally asks the user for uploading the X-Ray image of teeth to find the disease and find the category of that image

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

To run this file:
1. First set path of training dataset (Training Folder)
2. At the end, we have to add direct path of testing images
